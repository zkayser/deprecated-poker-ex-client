Original client-side code for PokerEx

This repo contains the original client-side code for [PokerEx](https://github.com/zkayser/poker_ex). The client-side implementation for PokerEx has been rewritten in Elm [here](https://github.com/zkayser/pokerex_client). Since the new client-side code exists, the initial client-side code that was contained within the PokerEx repo has fallen out of date and no longer functions as the application has evolved quite a bit. 

The original client-side code was written largely in plain ES6 and used JQuery for dom interactions. Although it was a clunky implementation since client-side code was not favored during the initial work done on PokerEx, there are some decent examples of integrating plain JS with Phoenix Channels.
